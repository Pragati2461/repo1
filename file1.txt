                    <h2>SAFETY TIPS</h2>

                    <p> Keeping Women's safety in mind, we have come up with some safety tips that every woman should know. After all, if we don't protect ourselves, who will?<br><bR>

                        Try sticking and shopping at the safest part of the city.<br>
                        Avoid getting overfriendly with strangers.<br>
                        While part of the excitement of travel is making new friends and talking to fellow travelers, never ever divulge your plans or itinerary to anyone.<br>
                        Never stay out late at night especially at strange places.<br>
                        Do not wear expensive jewelry or odd clothes while traveling as it may attract burglars.<br>
                        Try to carry cell phone along with you while traveling so that you can contact someone in case of emergency.<br>
                        Prefer wearing money belts and hidden pouches under your clothes to avoid pick pocketing.<br>
                        Always choose the safest mode of transport for traveling. Do check its previous safety track record.<br><br>
                        Always choose the safest mode of transport for traveling. Do check its previous safety track record.<br>
                        While staying at hotels, always keep your door locked whenever you are in your room. For added safety, keep the safety chain on to prevent any forced entry.<br>
                        Before opening the door to anyone, use the peephole. If the person is not in a hotel uniform or looks suspicious, do not open the door. Be wary of revealing your identity on the telephone, especially if you are traveling alone.<br>
                        You are a tourist but you don't need to let the whole world know that. Don't look like a tourist. Looking at maps in your car or on the street is a dead give-away. A camera hanging around your neck all the time is also not a sound idea.<br>
                        Don't flash money around. Just keep enough to meet your immediate needs. When traveling, your best protection is to be knowledgeable and alert. To travel with confidence and a positive attitude.<br>
                        Carry a pepper spray with you, always and keep it handy. Don't tuck it too low in your bag.   <br>
                        Hold your bag as tightly as you can when you are taking public transport. You can use it to hit your predator.<br>
                        When you are walking on a road, keep your mobile phone handy but avoid using it. Being on the phone makes you less alert.  <br>
                        When you are travelling in an auto alone, make sure you share the auto number with someone in your family even if it's during the day.<br>
                        Similarly, if you have booked a cab, always share your coordinates with someone.  <br> 
                        When in office, avoid going to isolated areas with no CCTV cameras.<br>
                        If you have parked your car, always look underneath, especially at night or at a less-crowded area. <br>
                        Whenever you are posting anything on social media, make sure you don't do it in real-time. Because if you do, you're telling people on your social media about your whereabouts. Delay those posts by say, 20-30 minutes.<br>
                        Always ensure you aren't posting anything on your social media with your address or phone number on it. <br>
                        Whenever you are giving out order for delivery at a grocery store, make sure you whisper your address or write it down somewhere and give it to the shopkeeper. Never announce it.<br>
                        Whenever you are getting your phone recharged, if it's at a store, don't loudly speak up your phone number. <br>
                        Always pour your own drinks at parties and don't ever take drinks from complete strangers or even friends. If you've left your drink unattended for even a few minutes, leave it and get a fresh drink. It may have been spiked when you weren't looking.<br>
                        If you feel someone is stalking you, try to find a crowded place and call someone for help</p>
